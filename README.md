This repository houses a Python project designed for transforming DOCX documents into a knowledge graph. The project follows a modular structure with dedicated modules for document parsing, knowledge graph construction, graph visualization, and utility functions. It is organized to accommodate future features such as building a n-gram database, implementing search functionality, and integrating with a language model (LLM). The project includes a testing suite for ensuring robust functionality. Feel free to explore and contribute to this versatile and extensible knowledge graph project
